#Writing Complexity measures on a L2 Japanese learner Corpus

In this term paper I will explore the quantification of syntactic language complexity in L2 Japanese learners by using measures commonly applied to European languages such as word count (per sentence and clause), corrected type token ratio (CTTR), and clauses per sentence.  I will use cross-sectional learner data from the International Corpus of Japanese as a Second Language(I-JAS). 
In my research I plan to adopt the syntactic complexity measures used in Vyakina (2012) which include words per sentence, finite verb units per sentence, words per FV unit, frequency of coordinating conjunctions, frequency of subordinating conjunctions, and corrected type-token ratio. Iwashita (2006) conducted a similar analysis and found that length measures increased between proficiency levels, as well as clauses per T-units. However, Iwashita’s study utilized a learner corpus of oral data which may have influenced the findings, considering variation in formatting between speech and writing. Furthermore, the division of the 33 learners into only 2 proficiency groups might have posed challenges in observing trends between proficiency levels, such as inverse correlation between coordinating and subordinating conjunctions as was observed in Vyatkina (2012). 
To address these limitations, I will analyze written data from the I-JAS which contains data from 1,000 L2 Japanese learners. The learners’ proficiency scores were obtained using the Japanese Computerized Adaptive Test (J-CAT), enabling us to group participants into multiple proficiency levels from basic to near native levels. 
While analyses of Japanese learner data are relatively scare, they provide invaluable insights into cross-linguistic comparisons of measures which can be used to analyze learner language. This paper aims to contribute to the advancement of cross-linguistic analysis and provide the researcher with more experience in processing Japanese text and language learner data.
