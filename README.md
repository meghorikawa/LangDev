# Cross-Sectional Analysis of Writing Complexity Measures on a Japanese Learner Corpus
### Final project for Summer 2023 Language Development HauptSeminar

## Abstract

This study explores different measures of writing complexity on a Japanese learner corpus. An analysis of writing samples from 687 Japanese learners and a native control group from the I-JAS corpus was conducted via automatically calculated measures. Findings align with those of other widely studied languages, where learners showed a consistent increase of sentence length, clause length, clauses per sentence, and control type token ratio. Consistent with previous studies a negative correlation between coordination and subordination was also observed.
