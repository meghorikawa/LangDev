# Cross-Sectional Analysis of Writing Complexity Measures on a Japanese Learner Corpus
### Final project for Summer 2023 Language Development HauptSeminar

## Abstract

This study explores different measures of writing
complexity on a Japanese learner corpus.
An analysis of writing samples from
687 Japanese learners and a native control
group, were analyzed via automatically calculated
measures. Findings align with those of
other widely studied languages, were learners
showed a consistent increase of sentence length,
clause length, clauses per sentence, and control
type token ratio. Consistent with previous studies
a negative correlation between coordination
and subordination was also observed.
